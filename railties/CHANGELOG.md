*   No longer add autoloaded paths to `$LOAD_PATH`.

    This means it won't be possible to load them with a manual `require` call, the class or module can be referenced instead.

    Reducing the size of `$LOAD_PATH` speed-up `require` calls for apps not using `bootsnap`, and reduce the
    size of the `bootsnap` cache for the others.

    *Jean Boussier*

*   Remove default `X-Download-Options` header

    This header is currently only used by Internet Explorer which
    will be discontinued in 2022 and since Rails 7 does not fully
    support Internet Explorer this header should not be a default one.
